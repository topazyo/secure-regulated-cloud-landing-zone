# Integration Test Orchestrator for Azure Compliance Scripts
#
# This script is a placeholder for orchestrating integration tests.
# It would typically perform the following steps:
# 1. Setup:
#    - Ensure necessary tools are installed (Terraform, Azure CLI, jq, diff).
#    - Authenticate to Azure.
#    - Potentially set environment variables needed by the scripts or Terraform.
# 2. Deploy Test Infrastructure:
#    - `terraform apply` the definitions in `tests/integration/infra/main.tf`.
#    - Capture outputs from Terraform (e.g., resource group name, specific resource names).
# 3. Run Compliance Scripts:
#    - Execute `verify-compliance.sh` against the deployed infrastructure.
#    - Execute `compliance-check.sh` against the deployed infrastructure.
#    - This might involve crafting specific `critical_controls.json`, `network_config.json`,
#      and `network_requirements.json` files for each test scenario, or using a comprehensive
#      set that covers all deployed "obstacle course" resources.
# 4. Validate Results:
#    - Compare the JSON reports generated by the scripts against expected JSON snippets.
#    - This requires a robust way to parse and compare JSON (e.g., using jq and diff,
#      or a dedicated JSON comparison tool/script). Only relevant parts of the report
#      should be compared to avoid brittleness.
# 5. Teardown:
#    - `terraform destroy` the infrastructure to clean up resources.
#
# Each "Test Case" block below is a conceptual outline.
